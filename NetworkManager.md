# NetworkManager on Ubuntu for People New to Networking

## Introduction
NetworkManager is a powerful tool for managing network connections on Ubuntu and other Linux distributions. As a newcomer to networking, understanding how to use NetworkManager can greatly simplify the process of connecting to wired and wireless networks, configuring network settings, and troubleshooting connectivity issues. In this tutorial, we'll explore the fundamentals of NetworkManager on Ubuntu and learn how to use it effectively in real-world scenarios.

## Core Concepts
1. **NetworkManager Daemon**: NetworkManager runs as a background service (daemon) on Ubuntu, constantly monitoring network devices and managing network connections.

2. **Network Devices**: NetworkManager can manage various network devices, including Ethernet interfaces (e.g., eth0) and wireless interfaces (e.g., wlan0).

3. **Network Connections**: NetworkManager uses connection profiles to store network configuration settings. Each connection profile contains information such as IP address, DNS servers, and authentication details.

4. **graphical user interface (GUI) and Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: NetworkManager provides both a GUI (e.g., GNOME Network Manager applet) and a CLI (e.g., `nmcli`) for managing network connections and settings.

## Practical Application
### Example 1: Connecting to a Wi-Fi Network
1. Click on the NetworkManager applet in the system tray.
2. Select the desired Wi-Fi network from the list of available networks.
3. Enter the Wi-Fi password when prompted and click "Connect".
4. NetworkManager will establish the connection and automatically store the connection profile for future use.

### Example 2: Configuring a Static IP Address
1. Open a terminal and run the following command to edit the connection profile:
   ```
   sudo nmcli connection edit <connection-name>
   ```
2. Set the IP addressing mode to "manual":
   ```
   nmcli> set ipv4.method manual
   ```
3. Configure the static IP address, subnet mask, and gateway:
   ```
   nmcli> set ipv4.addresses 192.168.1.100/24
   nmcli> set ipv4.gateway 192.168.1.1
   ```
4. Save the changes and activate the connection:
   ```
   nmcli> save
   nmcli> activate
   ```

### Example 3: Troubleshooting Network Connectivity
1. Check the network device status:
   ```
   nmcli device status
   ```
   Look for the device's state (e.g., "connected", "disconnected") and associated connection.

2. Verify the connection profile settings:
   ```
   nmcli connection show <connection-name>
   ```
   Review the IP address, DNS servers, and other relevant settings.

3. Restart the network connection:
   ```
   sudo nmcli connection down <connection-name>
   sudo nmcli connection up <connection-name>
   ```
   This can help resolve connectivity issues by re-establishing the network connection.

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls
1. Use descriptive names for connection profiles to easily identify them.
2. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions (e.g., sudo) when modifying network settings.
3. Be cautious when editing connection profiles, as incorrect settings can lead to network connectivity issues.
4. Keep your system updated to benefit from the latest NetworkManager features and bug fixes.
5. Use the appropriate NetworkManager tools (GUI or CLI) based on your preferences and the task at hand.

## Advanced Topics and Further Learning
1. **VPN Connections**: NetworkManager supports configuring and managing VPN connections, such as OpenVPN and WireGuard.
2. **Scripting with `nmcli`**: `nmcli` can be used in scripts to automate network configuration tasks.
3. **Firewall Integration**: NetworkManager integrates with firewall tools like `ufw` to manage network-related firewall rules.
