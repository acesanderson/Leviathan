Create a comprehensive tutorial for the `{{library_name}}` library in Python. Structure it as follows:

1. **Brief Introduction** (2-3 sentences)
   - What the module/library does
   - What manual/older approach it replaces or improves upon

2. **Conceptual "Why" Section** 
   - Explain the fundamental problem this solves
   - When you'd choose this approach over alternatives (memory vs files, manual vs automated, etc.)
   - Include a brief comparison showing the difference

3. **Key Functions/Classes** (3-5 most important ones)
   For each function:
   - Function name and one-line description
   - Complete, runnable code example with realistic use case
   - Inline comments explaining what happens
   - Focus on practical usage, not just syntax

4. **Common Use Cases** (4-6 bullet points)
   - Real-world scenarios where you'd reach for this tool
   - Specific problem domains it addresses

5. **Additional Benefits/Features**
   - Security, performance, or convenience advantages
   - Any gotchas or important considerations

**Style Guidelines:**
- Write for a developer who understands the language but hasn't used this specific tool
- Prioritize practical understanding over comprehensive API coverage
- Use complete, realistic examples rather than toy examples
- Explain the "ingredient's possibilities" rather than providing specific recipes
- Keep code examples focused and well-commented
- Assume the reader wants to understand when and why to use this tool

Target length: 400-600 words.
