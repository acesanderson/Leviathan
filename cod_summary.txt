n8n is a visual workflow automation tool that enables users to create custom workflows without      
coding, integrating various applications, APIs, and AI models. It combines automation features with 
AI capabilities, setting it apart from earlier platforms like Yahoo Pipes, IFTTT, Zapier, and Make. 
The article describes how author Matt Williams, a former member of the Ollama team, leverages n8n to
enhance his workflow through both cloud and local instances for handling AI-intensive tasks and     
general automation. His workflows include Dropbox backups, content curation and social media        
posting, AI-powered article summarization using Ollama's 3 billion parameter model, a               
webhook-triggered reformatting and Supabase table integration, daily news document generation,      
GitHub repository updates, and random interval tweet posting. While n8n offers powerful automation  
capabilities, flexible hosting options, and integration of AI tools, it also has limitations, such  
as the complexity of AI integrations through LangChain, which may reduce some of Ollama's strengths.
Despite these challenges, n8n remains a versatile tool for streamlining complex tasks and boosting  
productivity.
