ABOUT STATE OF THE TECH WORKFORCE
CompTIA designed State of the Tech Workforce, also referred to as Cyberstates, to serve
as a reference tool, making national, state, and metro area-level data accessible to a wide
range of users. State of the Tech Workforce quantifies the size and scope of the tech
industry and the tech workforce across multiple vectors. To provide additional context, the
report includes time-series trending, wage percentiles, business establishments, employer
job postings trending, digital skills trending, demographic profiling, emerging tech metrics,
and more.
As with any sector-level report, there are varying interpretations of what constitutes the
tech sector and the tech workforce. Some of this variance may be attributed to the
objectives of the author. Is the goal to depict the broadest possible representation of
STEM and digital economy fields, or a more narrowly defined technology subset? Is the
goal to capture all possible knowledge workers, or a more narrowly defined technology
subset? CompTIA weighs a number of factors in making these decisions. See the
methodology section for details of the specific NAICS codes and SOC codes CompTIA
uses in its definitions.
IMPORTANT NOTE about timing: the 2023 estimates and 2024 projections represent the
most up-to-date data at the time of reporting. As with any labor market data source there
is a lag effect and recent developments during late 2023 and early 2024 will likely not be
fully reflected in the data.

DEFINING NET TECH EMPLOYMENT
The tech workforce consists of two primary components, represented as a single figure by the ‘net tech employment’ designation.
The foundation is the set of technology professionals working in technical positions, such as IT support, network engineering,
software development, data science, and related roles. Many of these professionals work for technology companies (45%), but
many others are employed by organizations across every industry sector in the U.S. economy (55%).
The second component consists of the business professionals employed by technology companies. These professionals –
encompassing sales, marketing, finance, HR, operations and management, play an important role in supporting the development
and delivery of the technology products and services used throughout the economy. Approximately 39% of the net techemployment total consists of tech industry business professionals.
One final segment involves workers classified as self-employed. For the purposes of this report, only dedicated, full-time selfemployed technology workers are counted towards net tech employment. Workers that are characterized as “gig” workers, which
may entail working on the side for supplementary income, are excluded from this analysis due to several uncertainties with the data
and to minimize the possibility of double counting.

NET TECH EMPLOYMENT TRENDING
TECH INDUSTRY EMPLOYMENT TRENDING
KEY POINTS
⇥ The 2023 estimates and 2024 projections are presented
with the most up-to-date data at the time of reporting. As
with any labor market data source there is a lag effect and
recent developments during late 2023 and early 2024 will
likely not be fully reflected in the data.
⇥ For the most up-to-date employment trending data, see
CompTIA’s monthly Tech Jobs Report.
⇥ Net tech employment in the United States – as described
on the previous page, reached an estimated 9,620,582
workers in 2023, an increase of 1.2% year-over-year or
approximately 117,118 additional workers employed in
technology. Net tech employment is forecasted to grow
by 3.1% to 9.9 million in 2024.
⇥ Among the components of net tech employment, the tech
sector side of the equation is projected to grow 3.3% in
the year ahead, while the occupation side across the
economy is projected to grow at 3.5%.
⇥ Within the technology industry category, which
encompasses technology occupations and supporting
business occupations, growth has varied. Since 2018, the
IT services and custom software services category
powered job growth, accounting for 50% of job gains.
Software [product] accounted for 29% of the job gains in
the same time period. Tech manufacturing saw a fall in
number of jobs created in 2020 and 2021 but is
forecasted to grow at 1.8% in 2024.
⇥ The interconnected nature of technology across software
and applications, infrastructure and hardware, data,
support operations and cybersecurity, means job growth
tends to occur in concert. On a volume basis the large
software and IT support categories contribute the most to
employer gains numerically, while on a percent change
basis the categories covering all things data and
cybersecurity are growing the fastest.
⇥ Top projected growth occupations for 2024:
5.5% Data Scientists and Data Analysts
5.1% Cybersecurity Analysts and Engineers
4.8% Software Developers and Engineers
4.3% Software QA and Testers
4.3% Computer and Information research Scientists
3.6% CIOs and IT Directors
3.6% Web Developers
3.6% Web and Digital Interface Designers
⇥ Economic impact data further corroborates the
importance of the tech sector. As a percentage of the
overall U.S. economy, the tech industry accounts for 8.9%
of direct economic value, which translates to over $2
trillion.

THE DECADE AHEAD
KEY POINTS
⇥ According to projections from the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics and Lightcast, in the next ten years the tech
workforce will grow twice as fast as the overall U.S.
workforce. The macro trend of digital transformation
means demand for tech talent across the full spectrum of
tech job roles will continue unabated.
⇥ Calculating future workforce needs over the next decade
is a function of several variables. There is a growth
component, which may entail organizations adding
headcount due to expansion or possibly to support new
emerging technologies. There is a retirement factor, with a
portion of the workforce transitioning away from the labor
market permanently. And lastly, there is a segment leaving
the workforce for some other reason, also referred to as
separations. These may stem from a career change,
layoffs, a return to school, family pursuits, or other.
Changes to any of these variables will affect future
workforce projections.
⇥ The replacement rate for tech occupations during the
2024-2034 period is expected to average about 6%
annually, or approximately 350,000 workers each year,
totaling several million through 2034. The total turnover
rate, which encompasses workers transitioning within tech
such as those promoted into a new role, is estimated to
average 36% annually during the period. In comparison,
the highest turnover occupations have annual rates
typically in the 100%-200% range.
⇥ Tech occupation employment over the next 10 years is
expected to grow at about twice the rate of overall
employment across the economy. Projected tech growth
rates above the national rate:
304% Data Scientists and Data Analysts
267% Cybersecurity Analysts and Engineers
225% Software Developers and Engineers
177% Software QA and Testers
134% Web Designers and UI/UX
134% CIOs and IT Directors
125% Web Developers
86% Database Architects
82% Emerging Tech, IT Project Mgt., Other
73% Systems Analysts and Engineers
47% Network, Cloud Admin and Engineers
38% IT Support Specialists
17% Network/Cloud Architects
⇥ Employer job posting data from Lightcast provides another
layer of insight into the tech job market outlook. The data
provides a more up-to-date look at the skills and
experiences employers seek.
⇥ Overall tech job postings reached record levels during the
post-pandemic hiring frenzy of 2021-2022 and then fell
back to a normalized range. Note: job postings should not
be interpreted as unfilled jobs and there is not a 1:1
relationship between postings and actual hires made.

THE MANY FACETS OF WAGE DATA
KEY POINTS ANNUAL WAGE COMPARISON ACROSS OCCUPATIONS
⇥ There are many nuances to the tech wage discussion. At
the industry level – meaning the universe of technology
companies in the sector, wages encompass all staff
positions, from the CEO down to entry-level helpdesk
workers. Both technical and non-technical positions
factor into the industry wage calculation. Because of the
diversity of positions covered, interpreting summary
industry wage data requires accounting for these factors.
In comparison, tech occupation wages cover only
technical positions. This is the primary focus of the wage
data of this report.
⇥ Cost of living differences mean the wages in one location
are not directly comparable to another. For example, the
buying power of a salary in San Francisco will not go
nearly as far as in Des Moines. According to the National
Association of Realtors, the median price for a home in
Silicon Valley exceeds $1.2 million. See CompTIA IT
Salary Calculator for detailed wage data across 400+
metro areas.
⇥ Beyond location, the other important variables to
consider when reviewing wage data are job role, areas of
expertise, job experience, industry sector, and company
size. A skilled employee in a hot field such as artificial
intelligence, working for a Fortune 500 company, will earn
on average far more than a tech worker in an established
field, working for a small business in a rural area.
⇥ Percentiles help provide insight into wage ranges. This
approach minimizes the impact of outlier data points,
such as workers receiving massive stock payouts. It is
also useful in depicting wages along common career
paths, with workers just starting out earning wages at the
10th percentile, and then with experience and additional
training and certification, moving up through the higher
wage levels.
⇥ Across all tech occupation categories covered in this
report, the median wage, also referred to as the 50th
percentile or midpoint, was an estimated $104,556 in
2022, the most recent year of available government data.
This figure is more than double the median wage across
all occupations of the U.S. labor force. Note: sources
such as Glassdoor may provide more real-time data but
the tradeoff is a higher degree of data uncertainty than
data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
⇥ The scatterplot graph to the right illustrates the degree to
which wages will differ across states. The data presents
wages for software developers and IT support specialists
across percentiles. Tenth and 25th percentiles often
correspond to early-stage career positions (e.g. 0-4
years of experience), while 75th and 90th percentiles
cover higher-end experience and expertise.
⇥ When drilling down to the metro area level, wage
differences may become even more pronounced. Top tier
wages in locations such as San Jose or New York City
may run into hundreds of thousands, if not more when
factoring in bonuses or stock options.

KEY FINDINGS – NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT
U.S. NET TECH EMPLOYMENT
⇥ U.S. net tech employment totaled an estimated 9.6 million in 2023, a gain of
1.2% compared to the previous year. Net tech employment is projected to grow
at an estimated 3.1% year-over-year reaching 9.9 million in 2024.
⇥ Net tech employment accounted for approximately 5.9% of the overall U.S.
workforce in 2023. As noted previously, because of the blurring of lines across
industries, there is a degree of undercounting in tech sector employment.
U.S. TECH INDUSTRY EMPLOYMENT
⇥ U.S. tech industry employment totaled an estimated 6.4 million in 2023, an
increase of 63,336 workers from 6.3 million in 2022. Tech industry employment
is projected to grow at an estimated 3.3% year-over-year reaching 6.6 million in
2024. As noted, tech industry employment is a subset of net tech employment.
⇥ Tech manufacturing employment totaled an estimated 1.1 million in 2023 and is
projected to grow by 20,948 jobs in 2024.
⇥ Among the seven major tech manufacturing subsectors – the OEMs and
companies producing computing hardware, peripherals, semiconductors, etc.,
one is projected to experience employment losses, while the remaining
categories are projected to experience job gains.
⇥ Employment in the telecommunications and Internet services sector totaled an
estimated 1.6 million in 2023, projected to go up by 37,650 jobs in 2024. These
employment gains are driven by growth in the data processing, hosting, and
search portal services categories, where employment should increase by 36,220
jobs. Wired and wireless telecommunications services are projected to lose
7,207 jobs for the same time period.
⇥ The software category, consisting of general purpose software that is not
custom developed, also known as published or packaged software products
(including SaaS), employed an estimated 648,374 workers in 2023, and is
projected to add more than 37,000 net new jobs. On a percent change basis,
software will lead the tech sector with a 5.7% projected year-over-year growth
rate.
⇥ The IT services and custom software services subsector will generate the
largest numerical gain in employment, adding nearly 116,500 net-new jobs in
2024. This gain of 3.9% will increase the employment base to 3.14 million. This
growth reflects the ongoing digital transformations occurring across the
economy and the corresponding need for expertise in areas such as cloud
computing migration, application integration, process automation, data analytics,
and cybersecurity.
U.S. TECH OCCUPATION EMPLOYMENT
⇥ Tech occupation jobs reached an estimated 5.8 million workers in 2023 and is
projected to increase by 203,125 jobs in 2024. On a percent change basis, the
annual growth rate is 3.5%.
⇥ Since 2018, more than 760,000 new tech occupation jobs were added, a
function of the demand for tech talent across every industry sector in the
economy.
⇥ On a numeric basis, software developers, systems engineers and cybersecurity
analysts, network architects, and IT support specialists recorded the largest
gains in employment. While the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does not yet
break out many emerging tech roles, other data sources indicate these new
specialties are starting to make meaningful contributions to the growth of the
tech workforce.

KEY FINDINGS – STATE EMPLOYMENT
STATE NET TECH EMPLOYMENT
⇥ Most states experienced positive job gains in net tech employment from 2022
to 2023. States that saw losses include Alaska, North Dakota and
Massachusetts. The District of Columbia also saw a loss. All states are
projected to generate positive tech employment job growth in 2024.
⇥ While the largest job gains are associated with the states with a significant
tech presence, the fact that most states experienced tech employment job
gains speaks to the continued broad-based impact of technology across the
nation.
⇥ The metrics used to provide context and insight into the data tend to be
based on absolute size or are relative, which may involve percent change or
account for factors such as population or economic size differences. Absolute
measures tend to be highly correlated with the size of the state or metro area.
⇥ California is the largest state in the nation by a wide margin. Its population is
28% larger and its economy is 52% larger than the next largest state.
California’s economy is equal to the combined total of the bottom 25 states. It
follows California is the leader in many State of the Tech Workforce
categories related to size and scale.
⇥ California’s net tech employment was an estimated 1,533,554 workers in
2023, a gain of 471 net new jobs year-over-year. States that experienced
notable tech employment gains include Texas, Florida, New York, North
Carolina and Washington.
⇥ On a percent change basis, the top five states for job growth in 2023 were
Wyoming (+3.3%), West Virginia (+3.3%), Montana (+3.1%), Arkansas (+2.9%),
and Texas (+2.9%).
⇥ Employment concentration is a relative metric that compares tech
employment to the overall base of employment within a state. Sixteen states
are at a higher rate than the national average of 5.9%.
⇥ Washington and the District of Columbia have the highest concentration
(9.4%) of tech workers relative to its overall employment base, which means
citizens of the state are more likely to hold a tech job relative to other industry
sectors. Top ten states for net tech employment concentration:
⇥ Washington: 9.4%
⇥ District of Columbia: 9.4%
⇥ Virginia: 8.9%
⇥ Colorado: 8.5%
⇥ Massachusetts: 8.3%
⇥ New Hampshire: 8.1%
⇥ Maryland: 8.0%
⇥ California: 7.8%
⇥ Utah: 7.1%
⇥ Oregon: 6.7%
⇥ Conversely, the states with the lowest concentration of tech workers are:
Wyoming, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alaska, and West Virginia.

KEY FINDINGS – STATE TECH STARTUPS AND ECONOMIC IMPACT
STATE TECH COMPANIES AND STARTUPS DRIVE INNOVATION
⇥ Most states added to their base of tech business establishments. These could
be startups launching a new tech venture or established tech firms expanding
operations with another business unit (e.g. opening a new business
establishment in another state). Nationally, the count of tech business
establishments increased 5.0% in 2023, or the equivalent of 31,258 additional
business establishments.
⇥ On a numeric basis, Florida had the largest year-over-year increase of netnew tech business establishments (+2,474). Rounding out the top five for netnew tech business establishments were Virginia, Texas, New York, and North
Carolina. On a percent change basis, Montana experienced the largest
increase at 10.4%, followed by Vermont, Mississippi, Kansas, and Idaho.
STATE TECH ECONOMIC IMPACT
⇥ Economic impact is an assessment of output – the dollar value of goods and
services produced during a given year (also referred to as gross domestic or
regional product). As a percentage of the overall U.S. economy, the tech
industry accounts for 8.9% of direct economic value, which translates to over
$2.04 trillion.
⇥ A total of 30 states have a tech sector that generates $10 billion or more in
direct economic impact to the state. California tops the list at a massive
$542.5 billion in economic impact, representing 16.7% of the state’s economy.
On a dollar basis the other top states include New York, Texas, Washington,
Florida, and Massachusetts.
⇥ In addition to the direct economic impact, there are downstream, indirect
benefits of the technology industry. One way to assess this impact is the use
of job multiplier metrics, also referred to as input-output modeling. For
example, the IT services and custom software development services category
has an estimated jobs multiplier of 4.8. For every one job in this tech
subsector, an estimated 4.8 additional jobs are created or supported through
direct, indirect, or induced means.
STATE EMPLOYER JOB POSTINGS
⇥ On volume basis the top states for employer hiring activity via tech job
postings in 2023 were California, Texas, Virginia, Florida, and New York.
⇥ Top states for emerging tech job postings in 2023 were California (83,043),
Texas (46,530), Virginia (31,089), New York (30,286), Massachusetts(28,739),
and Illinois (25,970).
⇥ Emerging tech job postings as a percentage of total tech job postings are
highest in Massachusetts (29.9% of IT job postings are emerging tech), North
Dakota (28.9%), Vermont (28.8%), Washington (27.7%), and Maine (27.3%).
THE WORK FROM HOME (WFH) IMPACT
⇥ The job posting data confirms a momentous shift in thinking about work
location among employer and employees. Among all tech job postings in
2023, 21% specified a WFH or hybrid work option, or slightly over 608,400.

KEY FINDINGS – METRO AREA EMPLOYMENT
METRO AREA NET TECH EMPLOYMENT
⇥ The top ten metropolitan areas employ a about 3.5 million tech industry and tech
occupation workers, more than 1 in 3 tech workers in the nation.
⇥ New York City is the largest metropolitan area in the country by a wide margin. It
follows that it also has the largest base of tech employment.
⇥ Silicon Valley continues to be a critically important hub for innovation. Between
San Francisco and San Jose, there are a little more than 700,000 tech industry
and tech occupation workers. The discussion doesn’t end there, however, as
technology increasingly has a significant presence across the nation. Cities such
as Boston, Seattle, New York, Dallas, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Denver and more,
boast sizable tech workforces and notable job gain rates. This includes the
sometimes “under the radar” tech cities of Austin, Raleigh, Charlotte, Phoenix,
Detroit, Orlando, and more.
METRO AREA EMPLOYMENT CONCENTRATION
⇥ Employment concentration provides a measure of tech employment relative to
employment across all the other industry sectors in a local economy. Along with
economic impact as a percentage of a local economy, these metrics help to put
tech into context.
⇥ At 30.3%, San Jose has the highest concentration of net tech employment as a
percentage of its overall employment base.
⇥ Compared to the national tech employment concentration benchmark of 5.9%,
27 metro areas had the same rate or higher, confirming the importance of
technology to a far-reaching set of cities across the country.
METRO AREA TECH BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS
⇥ A large, dynamic base of business establishments, also referred to as company
locations, is another measure of a healthy tech sector. The New York City metro
area is home to 24,836 tech business establishments. Other top cities are
Washington DC, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Denver.
⇥ The vast majority of tech business establishments are categorized as small
businesses under the Small Business Administration’s definition of up to 500
employees.
⇥ Outside of the top five, the next largest metropolitan areas for the number of
tech sector business establishments include Seattle, Boston, Chicago, Miami,
and San Francisco.
METRO AREA EMPLOYER JOB POSTINGS
⇥ Cities with the most tech job postings in 2023 were Washington DC, New York,
Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Atlanta.
⇥ Emerging tech job positions were highest in New York City (39,760), Washington
DC (39,497), San Francisco (25,611), Boston (25,314), and San Jose (21,141)
round out the top five cities for emerging tech job postings.

CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS AND CHANGES OVER TIME
CompTIA’s State of the Tech Workforce (Cyberstates) utilizes the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) to define
the tech industry. The NAICS is a hierarchical system, with six-digit numbers assigned to the most specific industries. The NAICS is
constructed around the concept of production and is able to reflect advances in technology, including many new service-oriented
businesses. NAICS codes are revised periodically to reflect the emergence of new industry sectors or sub-sectors. Additionally,
CompTIA revises its definition of technology industry periodically to best meet the needs of our audiences.
Additionally, government labor market sources do occasionally enact backward revisions to the data, which may affect year-over-year
comparisons, especially with percent changes. The wage data is presented as current dollars, meaning the figures are for the given
year and not adjusted for inflation.
NET TECH EMPLOYMENT
The tech workforce consists of two primary components. Net tech employment is a single metric that encompasses both components,
making it easier to describe the tech workforce. The foundation is the set of technology occupation professionals working in technical
positions, such as IT support, network engineering, software development and related roles. Many of these professionals work for
technology companies (45%), but many others are employed by organizations across every industry sector or government entity in the
U.S. economy (55%).
The second component of the discussion consists of the business professionals employed by technology companies. These
professionals play an important role in supporting the development and delivery of the technology products and services used
throughout the economy. Thirty-nine percent of the net tech employment total consists of tech industry business professionals. See
page 5 of this report for more details on the concept of Net Tech Employment.
TECH INDUSTRY DEFINITION
There are a number of considerations when developing a definition of the technology industry. In some cases, NAICS codes do not
perfectly reflect industry dynamics. This can be especially challenging in times of rapid innovation, when new tech sectors emerge in a
short period of time. More recently, the degree to which technology has become core to so many industry sectors poses new
questions. For example, a technology platform designed to facilitate the online sale of goods may have traditionally been viewed as a
retailer, although given the intense use of technology, an argument could be made to classify it as a technology firm. Conceptually,
this report focuses on the sectors involved in making, creating, enabling, integrating, or supporting technology, whether as a product
or service. At this time, the report does not include industry sectors categorized primarily as users of technology.
TECH OCCUPATION DEFINITION
For occupation-level analysis, this report utilizes the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) System, which is a standard used by
federal agencies to classify workers into occupational categories. See following page.
WORKFORCE CHARACTERISTICS AND DIVERSITY INDEX
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tracks labor market composition across several demographic and firmographic
characteristics. By race and ethnicity, the BLS segments data by seven top-level categorizations. Described here:
https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/race-and-ethnicity/2019/home.htm. To measure overall race and ethnicity characteristics within the
tech workforce, this report uses a metric called Simpson’s Diversity Index. This index weights two key facets of race and ethnicity
within the workforce – richness and evenness (or think of it as depth and breadth) and reflects it in a single metric.
JOB POSTING DATA
Job posting data in this report refers to to active job postings - postings that were live during the time period, even if originally posted
in a previous period. Quarterly job postings data are estimates and should be viewed as directional. The basic digital skills job postings
and advanced digital fluency skills job postings charts are based on skills categorization groupings created by CompTIA using
Lightcast employer job posting data.
COST OF LIVING INDEX
The Cost of Living (COL) data in this report is published by Lightcast using baselines from the Council for Community and Economic
Research (C2ER) to assess how regional costs of living compare to the nation and to each other. The index (COLI) is comprised of six
major categories: grocery items, housing, utilities, transportation, health care, and miscellaneous goods and services. An index rating
below 100 translates to a lower relative cost of living, while an index rating above 100 means a higher relative cost of living. For more
details, please see Lightcast methodology page.

NAICS and SOCs are standard taxonomies developed by and used across government statistical programs. NAICS and
SOCs are updated on regular cycles, but because of the pace of change in technology, government taxonomies do tend to
lag the market. Additionally, the blurring of lines in technology means there are more gray areas in classification systems.
See government sites for more details on NAICS and SOCs.
