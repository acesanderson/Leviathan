[33m## Context Eviction[0m

[33mContext eviction refers to the systematic removal of earlier conversation turns or input tokens from an LLM's context [0m
[33mwindow when approaching token limits. This process typically follows a First-In-First-Out [0m[1;33m([0m[33mFIFO[0m[1;33m)[0m[33m methodology, where the[0m
[33moldest information is discarded to accommodate new inputs. In transformer-based architectures, this prevents attention [0m
[33mmechanism overload while maintaining recency bias in the model's reasoning. Advanced implementations may employ [0m
[33mpriority-based eviction strategies where tokens are removed based on semantic importance rather than temporal [0m
[33mpositioning.[0m

[33m## Context Pruning[0m

[33mContext pruning involves the selective elimination of lower-relevance content from the context window based on [0m
[33minformation density metrics. Unlike the more rudimentary eviction, pruning employs heuristic algorithms to identify and[0m
[33mretain semantically salient tokens while discarding redundant or peripheral content. Modern approaches include:[0m

[33m- Entropy-based pruning, which preserves high-information content[0m
[33m- Attention weight analysis to retain tokens with strong cross-attention scores[0m
[33m- Embedding similarity clustering to eliminate near-duplicate semantic representations[0m
[33m- Discourse structure analysis to maintain critical rhetorical elements[0m

[33mIn production systems, these techniques often operate in conjunction with retrieval-augmented generation [0m[1;33m([0m[33mRAG[0m[1;33m)[0m[33m [0m

[33m## Context Eviction[0m

[33mContext eviction refers to the systematic removal of earlier conversation turns or input tokens from an LLM's context [0m
[33mwindow when approaching token limits. This process typically follows a First-In-First-Out [0m[1;33m([0m[33mFIFO[0m[1;33m)[0m[33m methodology, where the[0m
[33moldest information is discarded to accommodate new inputs. In transformer-based architectures, this prevents attention [0m
[33mmechanism overload while maintaining recency bias in the model's reasoning. Advanced implementations may employ [0m
[33mpriority-based eviction strategies where tokens are removed based on semantic importance rather than temporal [0m

[33m## Context Pruning[0m

[33mContext pruning involves the selective elimination of lower-relevance content from the context window based on [0m
[33minformation density metrics. Unlike the more rudimentary eviction, pruning employs heuristic algorithms to identify and[0m
[33mretain semantically salient tokens while discarding redundant or peripheral content. Modern approaches include:[0m

[33m- Entropy-based pruning, which preserves high-information content[0m
[33m- Attention weight analysis to retain tokens with strong cross-attention scores[0m
[33m- Embedding similarity clustering to eliminate near-duplicate semantic representations[0m
[33m- Discourse structure analysis to maintain critical rhetorical elements[0m
