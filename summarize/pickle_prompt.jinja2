Synthesize our conversation into a dense information vector (targeting 10% of original length) optimized for future context reconstruction. Apply the following:

1. Structure with hierarchical topic tags using [TOPIC] and [SUBTOPIC] markers
2. Begin with a [USER_CONTEXT] section that captures:
   - Initial user problem statement and goals 
   - User's technical background and constraints
   - Expected application or implementation context
3. Preserve conversation turn sequence using {Q#}/{A#} notation for critical exchanges
4. For each exchange, include [USER_INTENT: x] to document the user's specific needs/questions
5. Maintain maximum information entropy by prioritizing:
   - Technical specifications and parameters
   - Non-obvious insights and constraints
   - Decision points with considered alternatives
   - Code snippets with critical comments only
6. Track critical user feedback using [USER_FEEDBACK: x] markers when preferences are expressed
7. Include original intent markers for each major topic using [INTENT: x]
8. Format in a retrieval-optimized structure with semantic anchors using <key_concept> tags
9. Include a "critical path" section that captures:
   - The minimal knowledge required to reconstruct solutions
   - The user's specific implementation priorities and constraints
10. End with a [CONVERSATION_STATUS] section that summarizes:
    - Current state of problem resolution (solved, partially solved, pivoted)
    - Outstanding questions or implementation gaps
    - Next steps identified but not yet addressed
    - Any evolving requirements or scope changes

Optimize for future LLM retrieval and context reconstruction rather than human readability.
